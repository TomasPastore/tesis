Connectivity measures were summarized by
calculating the median value from each electrode to all of the other
scalp (non-facial) electrodes. Note that, given the spatial distribution of
the electrodes, this procedure enhances the weight of long-distance
connections on the computed measure.

Except for event-related potential measures, analyses were per-
formed on EEG data recorded during the time period when subjects
were presented with undifferentiated series of tones (from 200 ms
before the onset of the first tone to the onset of the fifth tone).
Thus, all trials were pooled independently of the condition of auditory
stimulation. 


Definiciones. Razon ? 

EEG recordings were sampled at 250 Hz with a 256-electrode geodesic
sensor net (EGI) referenced to the vertex. Recordings were band-pass
filtered (from 0.2 to 45 Hz)

Trials were then segmented from
200 ms to + 1336 ms relative to the onset of the first sound. Trials
with voltages exceeding  150 mV, eye-movements activity exceeding
80 mV and eye-blinks exceeding  150 mV were rejected.
